# Hexed

I'm sure that name is already taken. I'll come up with a new name at some point. Maybe.

Hexed is a hex editor (actually, right now, a hex *viewer* - no editing is possible) that runs within [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron).

"But wait? Isn't that horribly inefficient?"

Yep.

It was also very quick to write and lets me add in features that I want, most of which have to do with writing small snippets of JavaScript to manipulate data and see how it works.

## Setting Up and Running

Right now getting Hexed up and running should be as simple as installing [node](https://nodejs.org/) and then running `npm install` followed by either `npm run win` (if on Windows) or `npm run mac` if on OS X.
